# üöÄ AI Arena:Mission-to-Mars


AI Arena is a competitive, multi-round, elimination-style web game where teams of players race to solve logic puzzles presented by a sentient Mars colony AI. This project demonstrates a full-stack application built with a Python/FastAPI backend, a React frontend, and a cloud-hosted MongoDB database, featuring real-time state management and dynamic content generation via the Groq LLM API.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  * **Real-time Multiplayer Lobby**: Players can join a lobby and see other connected players in real-time.
  * **Team-Based Gameplay**: An admin can dynamically create teams from the lobby to start the game.
  * **Dynamic Round System**: A multi-round, elimination-style game where the lowest-scoring team is removed after each round.
  * **Live Game Dashboard**: A main screen for players and admins to view a live leaderboard and a round countdown timer.
  * **AI-Powered Hints**: Players can request hints for challenging subtasks, which are dynamically generated by the Groq LLM.
  * **AI-Generated Reports**: At the end of the game, players receive a personalized "After-Action Report" narrated by the LLM, summarizing their performance.
  * **Full Admin Control Panel**: A dedicated admin view to manage the entire game flow: resetting the game, creating teams, and starting rounds.
  * **Role-Based Access**: A clear distinction between Player and Admin roles, with protected routes and conditional UI elements.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started: Local Setup

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### **Prerequisites**

  * Node.js and npm/yarn
  * Python 3.10+ and pip
  * MongoDB installed locally or a free MongoDB Atlas account
  * A Groq API Key

### **1. Backend Setup**

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create a .env file and add your credentials
# (rename .env.example to .env and fill it out)
```

**`backend/.env` file:**

```
MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"
```

```bash
# Run the backend server
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The backend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### **2. Frontend Setup**

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend-2.0

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file for the frontend
```

**`frontend-2.0/.env` file:**

```
REACT_APP_API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000"
```

```bash
# Run the frontend development server
npm start
```

The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üåê Deployment Workflow (Future)

This application is configured for a seamless deployment process:

1.  **Database**: A free cluster is created on **MongoDB Atlas**.
2.  **Backend**: The `backend` folder is deployed as a Web Service on **Render**. The `MONGO_URI` and `GROQ_API_KEY` are set as environment variables.
3.  **Frontend**: The `frontend-2.0` folder is deployed on **Vercel**. The `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable is set to the live URL of the Render backend.
4.  **CORS**: The live Vercel URL is added to the `origins` list in the FastAPI backend to allow communication.

-----

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

  * **WebSocket Integration**: Replace HTTP polling with WebSockets for instant, real-time updates.
  * **Persistent Player Profiles**: Allow users to create accounts and track their game history and stats.
  * **Expanded Content**: Add more scenarios and more complex, varied subtask types.
  * **Time-Based Scoring**: Introduce bonuses for finishing rounds quickly.
